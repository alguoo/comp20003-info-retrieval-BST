# Information Retrieval via BST
Objective is to use BST as a data structure to store and retrieve information, in this case, Olympics athletes across the years.

Two of the operations of the BST dictionary explored in this assignment is the insertion and search time complexity. Two factors which can impact this is:
1.	The order in which the data is inserted
    * Grouped
    * Randomly
    * Sorted
2.	The method of handling insertions of duplicate keys
    * Always placed as left child
    * Points to a linked list of duplicates

See report for the analysis.
